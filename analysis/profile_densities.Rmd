# Abstract

Here, I compare the speeds to my `dr1_norm` from the [UltimateDeconvolution](https://github.com/dcgerard/UltimateDeconvolution) package and `dmvnorm` from the `mvtnorm` R package. Since I am using more information (rank 1 + diagonal), mine should be faster. But the effects of writing it in C are so great that mine is actually much slower. The log-likelihoods agree, though.


```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
library(UltimateDeconvolution)
set.seed(17)
R <- 11
x <- stats::rnorm(R)
s_diag <- stats::rchisq(R, df = 5)
v <- stats::rnorm(R)
mu <- rep(0, length(x))
log <- TRUE
true_cov <- tcrossprod(v) + diag(s_diag)

melist <- list(x = x, v = v, s_diag = s_diag,
               mu = mu, log = log)

themlist <- list(x = x, mean = mu,
                 sigma = true_cov, log = log)

microbenchmark(
  do.call(dr1_norm, melist),
  do.call(mvtnorm::dmvnorm, themlist)
)
```

The log-likelihoods are also the same.

```{r}
medense <- dr1_norm(x = x, v = v, s_diag = s_diag,
                    mu = mu, log = log)
themdense <- mvtnorm::dmvnorm(x = x, mean = mu,
                              sigma = true_cov, log = log)

medense
themdense
```

```{r}
